# 📖 Booking App Frontend <a name="about-project"></a>

Welcome to the frontend of the Booking Cars Project, a cutting-edge application built using React and Redux technologies. Here, you can easily browse and reserve cars of your choice by selecting your preferred date and city for pickup, as well as specifying the return date.
Our user-friendly interface allows you to explore a diverse range of cars with detailed information. You can make informed decisions based on real-time availability, ensuring a seamless reservation process.
For added convenience and efficiency, certain pages within the app are restricted and can only be accessed by authorized admins. Admins have the privilege to add new cars to the inventory and delete existing ones, ensuring that the fleet is always up-to-date and well-maintained.

## 🚀 Live Demo <a name="live-demo"></a>

Currently, the live version of the app is not available. However, you can still view the app by following the provided prerequisites and process. Unfortunately, having a live version of a full-stack app can be quite expensive. I hope you understand the limitations we are facing. We are continuously working to improve the app and make it more accessible to everyone. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
